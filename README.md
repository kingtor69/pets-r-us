### how it works
 - **SQLAlchemy will be looking for a database called ***pets_r_us_db*****
 - there is not log-in or authentication, anyone can add or edit any pet
 - images (if present), names and availability status on the landing page are anchors taking you to specifics of that pet with a button there for editing 
   - css pseudo-classes :hover and :active are used change the display to indicate this
   - there is no deleting of pets, because pets can never be truly deleted, they can only be labelled as unavailable
